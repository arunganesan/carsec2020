	abstract = {Digital maps have become a part of our daily life with a number of commercial and free map services. These services have still a huge potential for enhancement with rich semantic information to support a large class of mapping applications. In this paper, we present Map++, a system that leverages standard cell-phone sensors in a crowdsensing approach to automatically enrich digital maps with different road semantics like tunnels, bumps, bridges, footbridges, crosswalks, road capacity, among others. Our analysis shows that cell-phones sensors with humans in vehicles or walking get affected by the different road features, which can be mined to extend the features of both free and commercial mapping services. We present the design and implementation of Map++ and evaluate it in a large city. Our evaluation shows that we can detect the different semantics accurately with at most 3\% false positive rate and 6\% false negative rate for both vehicle and pedestrian-based features. Moreover, we show that Map++ has a small energy footprint on the cell-phones, highlighting its promise as a ubiquitous digital maps enriching service.},

Existing works on driving behaviors monitoring using smartphones only provide a coarsegrained result, i.e. distinguishing abnormal driving behaviors from normal ones. To improve drivers' awareness of their driving habits so as to prevent potential car accidents, we need to consider a finegrained monitoring approach, which not only detects abnormal driving behaviors but also identifies specific types of abnormal driving behaviors, i.e. Weaving, Swerving, Sideslipping, Fast U-turn, Turning with a wide radius and Sudden braking. Through empirical studies of the 6-month driving traces collected from real driving environments, we find that all of the six types of driving behaviors have their unique patterns on acceleration and orientation. Recognizing this observation, we further propose a finegrained abnormal Driving behavior Detection and iDentification system, D3, to perform real-time high-accurate abnormal driving behaviors monitoring using smartphone sensors. By extracting unique features from readings of smartphones' accelerometer and orientation sensor, we first identify sixteen representative features to capture the patterns of driving behaviors. Then, a machine learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is employed to train the features and output a classifier model which conducts fine-grained identification.

	abstract = {We present CarSafe, a new driver safety app for Android phones that detects and alerts drivers to dangerous driving conditions and behavior. It uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms on the phone to monitor and detect whether the driver is tired or distracted using the front-facing camera while at the same time tracking road conditions using the rear-facing camera. Today's smartphones do not, however, have the capability to process video streams from both the front and rear cameras simultaneously. In response, CarSafe uses acontext-aware algorithm that switches between the two cameras while processing the data in real-time with the goal of minimizing missed events inside (e.g., drowsy driving) and outside of the car (e.g., tailgating). Camera switching means that CarSafe technically has a "blind spot" in the front or rear at any given time. To address this, CarSafe uses other embedded sensors on the phone (i.e., inertial sensors) to generate soft hints regarding potential blind spot dangers. We present the design and implementation of CarSafe and discuss its evaluation using results from a 12-driver field trial. Results from the CarSafe deployment are promising -- CarSafe can infer a common set of dangerous driving behaviors and road conditions with an overall precision and recall of 83\% and 75\%, respectively. CarSafe is the first dual-camera sensing app for smartphones and represents a new disruptive technology because it provides similar advanced safety features otherwise only found in expensive top-end cars.},

Indeed, there are three key stages characterizing our method: First of all, we proceed with driver’s face detection by Viola and Jones algorithm. Then, we extract the image reference and the non image reference coordinates from the face bounding’s box. Finally, based on measuring both the head inclination’s angle and distances between the extracted coordinates, we classify the head state (normal or inclined). Test results demonstrate that the proposed system can efficiently measure the aforementioned parameters and detect the head state as a sign of driver’s drowsiness.…},

Understanding and recognizing driving events that fall into these categories can aid in vehicle safety systems. Potentially-aggressive driving behavior is currently a leading cause of traffic fatalities in the United States. More often than not, drivers are unaware that they commit potentially-aggressive actions daily. To increase awareness and promote driver safety, we are proposing a novel system that uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and smartphone based sensor-fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, video) to detect, recognize and record these actions without external processing. Our system differs from past driving pattern recognition research by fusing related inter-axial data from multiple sensors into a single classifier. It also utilizes Euler representation of device attitude (also based on fused data) to aid in classification. All processing is done completely on the smartphone.},

We propose an approach to automatically detecting suspicious pickup locations from intercity bus GPS traces, and implement the approach in a geographical information system.

When there is sufficient evidence collected, map inference algorithms can automatically update the map. The CrowdAtlas server aggregates exceptional traces from users with the navigation app as well as from other, large-scale data sources. From these it automatically generates high quality map updates, which can be propagated to its navigation app and other interested applications. Using CrowdAtlas app, we mapped out a 4.5 km{\textasciicircum}2 street block in Shanghai in less than half an hour and built a walking/cycling map of the SJTU campus.

A significant part of congestion in urban areas is due to vehicles searching for on-street parking. Detailed and accurate on-street parking maps can help drivers easily locate areas with large numbers of legal parking spaces and thus relieve congestion. In this paper, we address the problem of mapping street parking spaces using vehicles' preinstalled parking sensors. In particular, we focus on identifying legal parking spaces from crowdsourced data, whereas earlier work has largely assumed that such maps of legal spaces are given. We demonstrate that crowdsensing data from vehicle parking sensors can be used to classify on-street areas into legal/illegal parking spaces. Based on more than 2 million data points collected in Highland Park, NJ and downtown Brooklyn, NY areas, we show that on-street parking maps can be estimated with an accuracy of 90\% using proposed weighted occupancy rate thresholding algorithm.},

	abstract = {We propose a segmentation and feature extraction method for trajectories of moving objects. The methodology consists of three stages: trajectory data preparation; global descriptors computation; and local feature extraction. The key element is an algorithm that decomposes the profiles generated for different movement parameters (velocity, acceleration, etc.) using variations in sinuosity and deviation from the median line. Hence, the methodology enables the extraction of local movement features in addition to global ones that are essential for modeling and analyzing moving objects in applications such as trajectory classification, simulation and extraction of movement patterns. As a case study, we show how the method can be employed in classifying trajectory data generated by unknown moving objects and assigning them to known types of moving objects, whose movement characteristics have been previously learned. We have conducted a series of experiments that provide evidence about the similarities and differences that exist among different types of moving objects. The experiments show that the methodology can be successfully applied in automatic transport mode detection. It is also shown that eye-movement data cannot be successfully used as a proxy of full-body movement of humans, or vehicles.},

Uneven road surfaces are identified from specific motion patterns which are described using a Hidden Markov Model based trajectory classification model.

	doi = {10.1109/IVS.2015.7225828},
	abstract = {Accurate on-road vehicle speed prediction is important for many intelligent vehicular and transportation applications. It is also challenging because the individual vehicle speed is affected by many factors, e.g., traffic speed, vehicle type, and driver's behavior, in either deterministic or stochastic ways. This paper proposes a novel vehicle speed prediction method in the context of vehicular networks, where the real-time traffic information is accessible. Traffic speeds of following road segments are first predicted by Neural Networks (NNs) based on historical traffic data. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are trained by the Baum-Welch algorithm with historical traffic and vehicle data to present the statistical relationship between vehicle speed and traffic speed. The forward-backward algorithm is applied on HMMs to extract vehicle's speed on each road segment along the driving route. Simulation is set up on the SUMO microscopic traffic simulator with the application of a real Luxembourg highway network and traffic count data. The vehicle speed prediction result shows that our proposed method outperforms other ones in terms of prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {The advances in mobile computing and social networking services enable people to probe the dynamics of a city. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting and describing traffic anomalies using crowd sensing with two forms of data, human mobility and social media. Traffic anomalies are caused by accidents, control, protests, sport events, celebrations, disasters and other events. Unlike existing traffic-anomaly-detection methods, we identify anomalies according to drivers' routing behavior on an urban road network. Here, a detected anomaly is represented by a sub-graph of a road network where drivers' routing behaviors significantly differ from their original patterns. We then try to describe the detected anomaly by mining representative terms from the social media that people posted when the anomaly happened. The system for detecting such traffic anomalies can benefit both drivers and transportation authorities, e.g., by notifying drivers approaching an anomaly and suggesting alternative routes, as well as supporting traffic jam diagnosis and dispersal. We evaluate our system with a GPS trajectory dataset generated by over 30,000 taxicabs over a period of 3 months in Beijing, and a dataset of tweets collected from WeiBo, a Twitter-like social site in China. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system.},

	abstract = {Identifying driving anomalies is of great significance for improving driving safety. The development of the Internet-of-Vehicle (IoV) technology has made it feasible to acquire big data from multiple vehicle sensors, and such big data play a fundamental role in identifying driving anomalies. Existing approaches are mainly based on either rules or supervised learning. However, such approaches often require labeled data, which are typically not available in big data scenarios. In addition, because driving behaviors differ under vehicle statuses (e.g., speed and gear position), to precisely model driving behaviors needs to fuse multiple sources of sensor data. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose SafeDrive, an online and status-aware approach, which does not require labeled data. From a historical dataset, SafeDrive statistically offline derives a state graph (SG) as a behavior model. Then, SafeDrive splits the online data stream into segments and compares each segment with the SG. SafeDrive identifies a segment that significantly deviates from the SG as an anomaly. We evaluate SafeDrive on a cloud-based IoV platform with over 29 000 real connected vehicles. The evaluation results demonstrate that SafeDrive is capable of identifying a variety of driving anomalies effectively from a large-scale vehicle data stream with an overall accuracy of 93\%; such identified driving anomalies can be used to timely alert drivers to correct their driving behaviors.},

Unlike past published work that requires high-resolution traces with dense sampling, we focus on situations with coarse granularity data, such as that obtained from thousands of taxis in Shanghai, which transmit their location as seldom as once per minute. Such data sources can be made available inexpensively as byproducts of existing processes, rather than having to drive every road with high-quality GPS instrumentation just for map building - and having to re-drive roads for periodic updates. Although the challenges in using opportunistic probe data are significant, successful mining algorithms could potentially enable the creation of continuously updated maps at very low cost. In this paper, we compare representative algorithms from two approaches: working with individual reported locations vs. segments between consecutive locations. We assess their trade-offs and effectiveness in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons for regions of Shanghai and Chicago.},

	abstract = {Smartphones have become pervasive due to the availability of office applications, Internet, games, vehicle guidance using location-based services apart from conventional services such as voice calls, SMSes, and multimedia services. Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods. This review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known research methodologies and provides a platform, to the researchers and practitioners, toward proposing the next-generation Android security, analysis, and malware detection techniques.},
