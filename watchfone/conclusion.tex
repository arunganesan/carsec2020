In this paper, we presented \watchfone{}, a car-security assistant which uses 
smartphone sensors to cross-validate and detect vehicular sensor falsification 
attacks. We used smartphone sensors to estimate six sensors inside the vehicle: 
speed, fuel level, odometer, engine RPM, gear position and steering wheel angle. 
Using driving traces and simulated injections, we have demonstrated \watchfone's ability 
to detect injections which have sufficient magnitude of attack (e.g., enough to 
actually impact the car or confuse driver) very quickly after the attack onset.

We focused on these six sensors, but \watchfone{} can easily be extended to many more 
sensors within the vehicle. Furthermore, through the combination of multiple phones, 
other IoT devices, and rich media sensors on the phone (e.g., cameras and microphones), 
we can extend the space of sensors which can be cross-validated using \watchfone{}. This 
work lays the groundwork for future researchers to expand on the idea of using 
smartphones for car-security assistance.
